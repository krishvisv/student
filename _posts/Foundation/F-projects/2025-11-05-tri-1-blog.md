  <h2>Compare yourself to the beginning of the year</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At the beginning of the year I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I felt like a fish out of water — or a notebook in the wrong folder — trying to figure out what I was doing and how to survive.</li>
    <li>It took me a week to figure out how to embed an image.</li>
    <li>Now, I have more of a base of how coding works. I am a lot better at troubleshooting and understanding syntax, and do a much better job of producing things that work.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Remember key things from 3 sprints — Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python, West Coast Travel or Digital Famine</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A key takeaway I had from the tools setup was getting a lot better at debugging and finding useful code information, which came in handy for the next sprint by also familiarizing me with the vocabulary and workspace of the class.</li>
    <li>A key takeaway I had from the Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python sprint is the differences between the two syntaxes, remembering what needs to be added, and getting better at reading and deciphering harder code because I am writing it.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>How N@tM went — did you get a comment or two you liked?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Poorly.</li>
    <li>Our team lacked good communication; everyone was very singular after the initial brainstorming phase, so the end result wasn’t as cohesive as it could be.</li>
    <li>We chose simplistic things to accomplish rather than branching out into innovation for ideas.</li>
    <li>Our end result was not very interactive, and so it wasn’t very interesting or unique at all.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What do you want to do next on project, given time?</h2>
  <p>Establish better communication, make roles more clear but also more collaborative, and think more about user experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What do you want to learn next in CompSci?</h2>
  <p>I want to do more projects like the digital-famine — it was fun. I want to get better at teamwork and communication, and learn about bits.</p>
</div>

  <h2>MCQ review, score, correction, and approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I chose to take the test by leaving blank things I didn’t understand, and focusing on what I knew so I could do thorough corrections and actually learn, instead of guessing correctly.</li>
    <li>I got a score of 37/66.</li>
    <h3> Questions I missed: </h3>
    <li> 1, 3, 6, 14, 20, 26, 28, 29, 31, 37-40, 42-44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 54-57, 60, 63, 65, 66 </li>
    <h3>  Skills I missed: </h3>
    <h4> 1: Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose </h4>
    <li> A: Investigate the situation, context, or task </li> 
    <li> C: Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution </li>
    <li> D: Evaluate solution options </li>
    <p> Citizen science is "the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.". If you display the variable before or after running it through a procedure, it will have the same number of values, but the values themselves differ (i.e. 1-10 vs 2-11). You can simplify code by running repetitive functions outside of for-loops so instead of repeating them for each variable, it only runs once at the end of the for-loop. If the number of steps in an algorithm is a polynomial, the algorithm will run in reasonable time. Bits mean 2^ that number. so 4-bit means 2^4, allowing for any integer between 0 and 15 inclusive. An undecidable problem is not possible. </p>
    <h4> 2: Develop and implement algorithms </h4>
    <li> B: Implement and apply an algorithm </li>
    <p> Make sure you pay attention to location of procedures and dependencies. If one part of an "and" statement is false, the whole statement is false. Check code to make sure it runs correctly. </p>
    <h4> 3: Develop programs that incorporate abstractions </h4>
    <li> B: Use abstraction to manage complexity in a program </li>
    <li> C: Explain how abstraction manages complexity </li>
    <p> Read through code carefully. Same explanation of bits from skill 2. A generalization of the procedures "square" and "cube" is power(n , m) which results in n^m. Substrings are inclusive of the first number. </p>
    <h4> 4: Evaluate and test algorithms and programs </h4>
    <li> B: Determine the result of code segments </li>
    <li> C: Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing </li>
    <p> Q1 I could not for the life of me make sense of, my brain was not working. The college board explanation -> The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged. The MOD expression calculates the remainder, so it evaluates to true if the remainder is 0. A linear search sequentially compares each element of the list with the target
value. The list does not need to be sorted. Read through code to make sure there aren't tricks employed. Read!! Through!! Code!!! Carefully!!!!! Make sure inital values are held outside of loops, or it resets every time.  </p>
    <h4> 5: Investigate computing innovations </h4>
    <li> A: Explain how computing systems work </li>
    <li> B: Explain how knowledge can be generated from data </li>
    <li> D: Describe the impact of gathering data </li>
    <li> E: Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors </li>
    <p> The IETF develops and oversees standards such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), Internet protocol (IP), and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). Open standards and protocols are used to prescribe the format of data sent over the Internet. This allows all connected hardware and software to communicate in a standard way. Make sure you understand the context of a situation. In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key. Symmetric encryption is a method that uses a single, shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. (I literally just didn't know any of this vocab) </p>

  <h2>Something cool you'd like to share</h2>
  <p>The theming I did on this blog! Also, a bit of a retrospective but the way people used to learn/copy code on myspace to customize their pages. I think that's really cool. I tried to emulate that aesthetic on this page. I also like spacehey, which is a replica of old myspace where a lot of emo people go to pretend like it's still 2008. When I made my blog 3 years ago, I just copied a template, but now I can actually read and understand the html involved, and how it's working to change the site layout and appearance. </p>
