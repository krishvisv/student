## Compare yourself to the beginning of the year

- At the beginning of the year I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I felt like a fish out of water- or a notebook in the wrong folder- trying to figure out what I was doing and how to survive. It took me a week to figure out how to embed an image. Now, I have more of a base of how coding works. I am a lot better at troubleshooting and understanding syntax, and do a much better job of producing things that work.

## Remember key things from 3 sprints- Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python,  West Coast Travel or Digital Famine.

- A key takeway I had from the tools set-up was getting a lot better at debugging and finding useful code information, which came in handy for the next sprint by also familiarizing me with the vocabulary and workspace of the class.
- A key takeaway I had from the fundamentals of Javascript/Python sprint is the differences between the two syntaxes, remembering what needs to be added, and getting better at reading and deciphering harder code because I am writing it 

## How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?

- Poorly
- Our team lacked good communication, everyone was very singular after the inital brainstorming phase, so the end result wasn't as cohesive as it could be
- We chose simplistic things to accomplish rather than branching out into innovation for ideas
- Our end result was not very interactive, and so it wasn't very interesting or unique at all

## What do you want to do next on project, given time?

-Establish better communication, make roles more clear but also more collaborative, think more about user experience

## What do you want to learn next in CompSci?

- I want to do more projects like the digital-famine, it was fun. I want to get better at teamworking and communication, and learn about bits

## Analytics review.

## MCQ review, score, correction, and approach

- I chose to take the test by leaving blank things I didn't understand, and focusing on what I knew so I could do thorough corrections and actually learn, instead of guessing correctly
- I got a score of 37/66

## Something cool you'd like to share.
