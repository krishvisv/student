  <h2>Compare yourself to the beginning of the year</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At the beginning of the year I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I felt like a fish out of water — or a notebook in the wrong folder — trying to figure out what I was doing and how to survive.</li>
    <li>It took me a week to figure out how to embed an image.</li>
    <li>Now, I have more of a base of how coding works. I am a lot better at troubleshooting and understanding syntax, and do a much better job of producing things that work.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Remember key things from 3 sprints — Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python, West Coast Travel or Digital Famine</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A key takeaway I had from the tools setup was getting a lot better at debugging and finding useful code information, which came in handy for the next sprint by also familiarizing me with the vocabulary and workspace of the class.</li>
    <li>A key takeaway I had from the Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python sprint is the differences between the two syntaxes, remembering what needs to be added, and getting better at reading and deciphering harder code because I am writing it.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>How N@tM went — did you get a comment or two you liked?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Poorly.</li>
    <li>Our team lacked good communication; everyone was very singular after the initial brainstorming phase, so the end result wasn’t as cohesive as it could be.</li>
    <li>We chose simplistic things to accomplish rather than branching out into innovation for ideas.</li>
    <li>Our end result was not very interactive, and so it wasn’t very interesting or unique at all.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What do you want to do next on project, given time?</h2>
  <p>Establish better communication, make roles more clear but also more collaborative, and think more about user experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What do you want to learn next in CompSci?</h2>
  <p>I want to do more projects like the digital-famine — it was fun. I want to get better at teamwork and communication, and learn about bits.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Analytics review</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h2>MCQ review, score, correction, and approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I chose to take the test by leaving blank things I didn’t understand, and focusing on what I knew so I could do thorough corrections and actually learn, instead of guessing correctly.</li>
    <li>I got a score of 37/66.</li>
  </ul>
