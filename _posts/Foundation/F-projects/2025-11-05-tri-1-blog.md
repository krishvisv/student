## Compare yourself to the beginning of the year

- At the beginning of the year I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I felt like a fish out of water- or a notebook in the wrong folder- trying to figure out what I was doing and how to survive. It took me a week to figure out how to embed an image. Now, I have more of a base of how coding works. I am a lot better at troubleshooting and understanding syntax, and do a much better job of producing things that work.

## Remember key things from 3 sprints- Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python,  West Coast Travel or Digital Famine.

- 

## How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?

## What do you want to do next on project, given time?

## What do you want to learn next in CompSci?

## Analytics review.

## MCQ review, score, correction, and approach

- I chose to take the test by leaving blank things I didn't understand, and focusing on what I knew so I could do thorough corrections and actually learn, instead of guessing correctly
- I got a score of 37/66
## Something cool you'd like to share.
